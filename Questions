Questions:
Retrieve all the data from the Alzheimer’s dataset.
Alter the column types for various fields (e.g., Age, EDUC, SES, MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV, ASF).
Retrieve the average age and MMSE score for each group ("Demented" or "Nondemented").
Find individuals with an MMSE score below the average MMSE score of their respective group.
List all individuals whose SES is NULL. Provide their age and group.
Find the top 5 youngest individuals with an ASF greater than the median ASF of the dataset.
Count the number of males and females in each group.
Calculate the average nWBV for individuals with a CDR of 0.5, grouped by SES.
Identify the age range (min and max age) for each group and gender combination.
Find individuals whose eTIV is higher than the average eTIV of all "Nondemented" individuals.
Retrieve all individuals with an MMSE score higher than the average MMSE score of individuals in their own SES group.
Use a CTE to find the average ASF for each group. Then, retrieve individuals whose ASF is above their group’s average.
Use a recursive CTE to simulate categorizing individuals into percentile groups based on their eTIV values.
Add a column that ranks individuals based on their MMSE score within each group.
Compute the running average of nWBV values for individuals ordered by age within their group.
Create a query that calculates the percentile rank of individual eTIV within their respective group.
Assuming you have another table containing region-wise Alzheimer’s statistics, join it with this dataset to find regions with the highest average CDR.
Combine data from another table (e.g., socioeconomic status by region) to analyze if individuals from a specific SES level tend to have higher MMSE scores.
Create a new column categorizing individuals into "Young" (Age < 65), "Middle-Aged" (65 ≤ Age < 80), and "Senior" (Age ≥ 80).
